    "The Binomial probability model has a wide range of uses in the real world. Binomial is associated with situations where there are two outcomes, frequently labeled success or failure. Research often involves quantifying the probability that an event occurs, the percentage of successes in a population, or the likelihood of certain outcomes that can be classed as success or failure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each probability model has its own set of properties. In order for a random variable to be considered to have the properties or characteristics of a binomial distribution it must meet the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A random process with a fixed number of trials (n).\n",
    "- The outcome of each trial can be classified as success or failure. \n",
    "- The probability of success (p) is the same for each trial.\n",
    "- The trials are independent, so, the outcome of one trial does not influence the result of the next. \n",
