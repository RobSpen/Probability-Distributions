    "The binomial distribution can be used to model real world scenarios where the events can be classified as one of two possible outcomes (success or failure). Using the binomial we can calculate the probability of obtaining a given number of success (x) from a fixed number of trials (n), with a probability (p) of success on each trial that does not change and the outcome of each trial is independent of all previous trials.\n",

    "In this notebook I will use the binomial distribution to calculate probabilities. Specifically, I will use the Probability Mass Function for the binomial and the Cumulative Distribution Function to obtain probabilities. On this occasion I will make use of the python Math library to calculate and wirk with the binomial distribution."
