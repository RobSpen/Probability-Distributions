    "# Binomial Probability Distribution using the Scipy Library\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous notebooks, I have demonstrated how to create functions to obtain the Probability Mass Function (pmf) and Cumulative Distribution Function (cdf) for the Binomial distribution. These allow us to calculate probabilities for random variables that follow the binomial distribution and model processes where we are interested in the probability of a given number of successes from a fixed number of trials, where each trial is independent and has the same success probability. \n",

    "In this notebook, I will again obtain the pmf and cdf for the binomial distribution in Python, but this time I will use the Scipy software library. "
