# Exploring Probability Distributions Using Python 

## An tutorial series exploring probability distributions using Python

Rob Spencer is a Lecturer in the Psychology Department at Middlesex University, London. He is a behavioural scientist specialising in quantitative research methods and data analysis.

## Description

This repository was created to host the jupyter notebooks used in an associated video playlist on my youtube channel. The relevant playlist is titled Exploring Probability Distributions Using Python. The purpose of that series of youtube videos is to discuss some of the most commonly encountered probability distributions, and their parameters, when doing research or collecting data on variables in psychology and the behavioural sciences. In these notebooks and the linked video series I discuss the parameters for different probability distributions and provide examples of how to simulate random variables and data to explore the properties of these distributions using the different software libraries available in Python. I hope these notebooks (and videos) are useful and help you to develop your understanding of the different types of probability distribution and the types of data to which they apply.    

The target audience for this tutorial series includes new Python users who have some background in introductory statistics and data analysis. 

## User Instructions

Users familiar with git, may simply clone this repository to obtain the materials (Jupyter notebooks). Alternatively you may download individual files or simply view the static notebooks by clicking on them. To get the most out of these resources I recommend running the notebooks in conjunction with watching the youtube video series. 

## Required Packages

Listed below are the different packages used in this tutorial series. It is advised that you install the most recent versions using pip or conda. 

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
